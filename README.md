# Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Analysis whilst playing Fortnite

Fortnite is a free game created by Epic Games that has a 100-player PvP mode. This mode is essentially last man standing. As the number of players alive in the game decrease, nerves and fear tend to build up (unless you're a pro at this game and know what you're doing). I intend on measuring this fear via a heart rate monitor through two features - heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV).
